                            <strong>Particle System 1:</strong> This is one of the many attempts and configurations i tried, this has a 17unit circle radius, 0.1unit gravity-strength and 250 particles, this runs somewhat smoothly with about 40fps but isnt too exciting with only 250 particles.

                            <strong>Particle System 2:</strong> This example has a 7unit circle radius, 0.175unit gravity-strength and 425 particles. Obviously the FPS is much worse sitting at about 15 throughout but it does have twice as many particles.

                    <div>
                        <p>I kinda just messed around with the settings as problems crept up with particles sticking inside one another or the boundaries when they were too small with too large of a gravity, but small gravities looking ugly with particles falling slowly and so ig its dealers pick with how it looks.</p>
                        <p>My biggest take from this is that python sucks for these kinda simulations as ik using pygame isnt amazing as its not optimized AT ALL and there are better libraries but i think for a fluid simulator c++ c or c# is best. ALTHOUGH do note my MATHS is NOT 100% correct in this AT ALL i did my best tho :)</p>
                        <p>Lastly my final note for this project: bro i have to write all of this in HTML and format it so it looks good i spent like 3 hours doing all of this and tryna do other stuff i failed at such as making the code runable from the website so yall can try it out BUT THAT IS HARD anyway next time xx</p>

                        <p>If anyone gives a monkey about the maths behind all this, i did it really simply im not smart enough to use crazy equations with itegration and differentials so basically the entirety of the maths is the pythagorean theorum used to calculator velocities between boundaries and collisions and basic trig for calculating the angle in which particles bounce :)</p>
